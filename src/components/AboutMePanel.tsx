              I've built my career at the intersection of strategy, client growth, and revenue innovationâ€”turning untapped potential into tangible results. With a track record spanning Ed-Tech, Finance, and SaaS, I'm eager to bring this expertise to your team.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Client Growth Partner, I drove revenue growth for Fortune 2000 clients in EMEA and APAC by creating GTM strategies, defining ICPs, and building pipelines that expanded TAM and delivered transformative business results.
            </p>
            <p>
              At ICICI Bank, I managed corporate portfolios and sharpened my client engagement skills, while at Cerebry, I crafted pricing strategies and built sales pipelines that fueled revenue growth. At Quolum, I bridged the gap between product and customer needs, driving adoption and delivering value to SaaS users.
            </p>
            <p>
              With an MBA, a Bachelor of Technology, and hands-on experience scaling opportunities across regions and industries, I thrive on solving complex problems and creating pathways for growth. I'd love the chance to hone my skills in strategy, execution, and client success aligning with organisations' vision and goals.
